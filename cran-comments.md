This is the initial relase of the 'tidypaleo' package. The problems
noted by the initial CRAN reviewer (missing one `\value` Rd tag)
have been fixed. The initial review noted that if there are published
methods referred to by the package that they should be documented in
the package Description. The paper describing this package has been
accepted to the Journal of Statistical Software and will be published
soon; however, the paper cannot be published until the package is
available on CRAN. I will update the Description with a link to
the paper when it has been published.

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Paleoenvironmental (2:23)
  stratigraphic (8:3, 9:14, 11:23, 13:3)
  
These terms are central to the content of this R package
and are spelled correctly.
